<ins>**Project Objective:**</ins>    
The objective of this software is to simplify the peer assessment process with a functional performance review platform that lets team project organizers create standardized feedback forms with ease. After signing up, a user should be able to create actionable content and forms with a few clicks. 
Users will be able to schedule distribution of the questionnaires, easily design questionnaires with templates, and customize their questions. Automated reminders can be scheduled when the survey opens, 24 hours before the deadline, as well as a couple hours before it closes. Once the deadline passes, analytical results will be created for team members and the entire group. Finally, the results can be published for team members to see their own performance assessed, as well as an anonymous scatter plot of the whole group so team members can see their performance relative to others. The user journey will be intuitive to eliminate user-frustration and increase retention for project leads to continue using our service.
